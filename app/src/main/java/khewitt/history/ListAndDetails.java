            " completed this calculator, designed by researcher George Stibitz.  In 1940, Stibitz" +
            " demonstrated the CNC at an American Mathematical Society conference held at " +

    ,"Konrad Zuse finishes the Z3 computer. The Z3 was an early computer built by German engineer" +
            " Konrad Zuse working in complete isolation from developments elsewhere. Using 2,300" +
            " relays, the Z3 used floating point binary arithmetic and had a 22-bit word length. " +
            "The original Z3 was destroyed in a bombing raid of Berlin in late 1943. However, " +
            "Zuse later supervised a reconstruction of the Z3 in the 1960s which is currently " +

            "Bombe design was greatly influenced by the work of computer pioneer Alan Turing and " +

    ,"The Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) is completed. After successfully demonstrating a " +
            "proof-of-concept prototype in 1939, Atanasoff received funds to build the full-scale" +
            " machine.  Built at Iowa State College (now University), the ABC was designed and" +
            " built by Professor John Vincent Atanasoff and graduate student Cliff Berry between" +
            " 1939 and 1942. The ABC was at the center of a patent dispute relating to the " +
            "invention of the computer, which was resolved in 1973 when it was shown that ENIAC" +
            " co-designer John Mauchly had come to examine the ABC shortly after it became functional.\n" +

            "The legal result was a landmark: Atanasoff was declared the originator of several" +
            " basic computer ideas, but the computer as a concept was declared un-patentable and " +
            "thus was freely open to all. This result has been referred to as the \"dis-invention" +
            " of the computer.\" A full-scale reconstruction of the ABC was completed in 1997 and" +
            " proved that the ABC machine functioned as Atanasoff had claimed."

           " The team first built a large analog computer, but found it inaccurate and inflexible." +
           " After designers saw a demonstration of the ENIAC computer, they decided on building" +
           " a digital computer. By the time the Whirlwind was completed in 1951, the Navy had" +
           " lost interest in the project, though the U.S. Air Force would eventually support the" +
           " project which would influence the design of the SAGE program."

   ,"Harvard Mark-1 is completed. Conceived by Harvard professor Howard Aiken, and designed and" +
           " built by IBM, the Harvard Mark-1 was a room-sized, relay-based calculator. The machine" +
           " had a fifty-foot long camshaft that synchronized the machine’s thousands of component" +
           " parts. The Mark-1 was used to produce mathematical tables but was soon superseded" +
           " by stored program computers."
